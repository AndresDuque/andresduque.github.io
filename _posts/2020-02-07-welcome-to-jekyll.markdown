Hello there! 

My name is Andr√©s Duque and I am a software engineer. Born in Colombia, raised in Spain and currently living in Switzerland and working as a software engineer within the medical devices domain.

I am a guy who came as a exchange student back in 2014 to the helveltic country who suddenly had the opportunity to stay working as a software engineer, that, lately found himself working under the medical device enviroment, thing that I really liked and I am looking to stay within the same domain for gaining more experience since it is a way to impact people's lives in a good way.

Said that, that doesn't meaning I am not meesing around learnig new technologies and creating any dummy project.

You will a small part of me here!


Be welcome!
